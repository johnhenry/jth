# Tooling for jth

Jth is brand-new and experimental. No official tooling is yet available...

## Highlighting

If you can't live without text highlighing,
try setting your editor
to recognize jth code as javsscript.
It mostly works, but there's currently an issue with the `/*` operator triggering comments

Be careful as auto-formating as jth code as javascript my break code.
